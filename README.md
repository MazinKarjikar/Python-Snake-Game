# Python-Snake-Game
Recreated the classic arcade Snake Game in Python using the Pygame library. Very fun first project in Python.

## Description
I wanted to learn Python - I am familiar with Java and other languages, but I never got familiar with Python. I thought the best way to
do so was to recreate a simple well known game. It keeps track of your score, as well as continually randomly spawns food. If you hit the
edges of the screen, or you hit your own body, you will lose!

### Dependencies
* Python installed
* Pygame Library installed

### How to play
* Download Snake Game.py executable
* Run it! 
* If you lose, press C to play again or Q to quit!
